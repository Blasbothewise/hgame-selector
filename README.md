# Hgame selector
A desktop application for visualising and navigating your hgame collection.

## Notable features:

- Navigate your hgame collection via large icons representing circles and hgames utilising their cover art.
- Import metadata from DLsite so all you need to do is supply the game's executable.
- Directory scanner + auto importer/scraper , Add your entire directory and if the hgame's have a dlsite code in their path, they'll be picked up and metadata aquired.
- Mega.nz and IPFS directory scanner/downloader for browsing community hgame archives. (IPFS scan requires your daemon running)
